//
// When implementing this interface, the implementee must ensure that the data passed
// to any call of [Hasher] is prefix free.
// This means that values which are not equal should cause two different sequences of
// values to be written, and neither of the two sequences should be a prefix of the other.
//
// In simple words: if a struct hash two string fields and [Hasher.WriteString] is called
// successively, the caller must ensure that the resulting hash is unique.
// I.e., the string tuples ("ab", "c") and ("a", "bc") must result in a different hash.
